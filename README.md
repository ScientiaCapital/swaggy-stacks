## ⚠️ Important Disclaimers (The Boring but Necessary Stuff)

### 📈 About Trading
- **Paper Trading Only**: This system is designed for educational and paper trading purposes
- **Not Financial Advice**: We're developers, not financial advisors (shocking, we know)
- **Risk Warning**: Trading involves risk. Don't bet more than you can afford to lose
- **Past Performance**: Doesn't guarantee future results (despite what the fancy charts suggest)

### 🔒 Security & Privacy
- All trading happens in paper mode by default (your real money is safe)
- Email alerts are optional (but highly recommended for entertainment value)
- We don't store real trading credentials (we're paranoid about security)

### 🧪 Development Status
- **Production-Ready**: The monitoring and infrastructure are enterprise-grade
- **Active Development**: New features added regularly
- **Well-Tested**: We test our code more than most people test their relationships
